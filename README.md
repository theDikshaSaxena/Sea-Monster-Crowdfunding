# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Submitted by: Diksha Saxena

Sea Monster Crowdfunding is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
We can probably have a drop down or buttons to pick the stats and include more stats on the page. Instead of having the stat value listed on the page, we can display it after clicking on the stat name. I haven't implemented it, but it should be fairly simple.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented features:

## Notes

For challenge 5, the comments are a little misguiding. It says unfunded even for the funded part. Corrected the comment. 
Also, the game cards are displayed 3 at a time in my app, instead of 4 in a row, because it is probably responsive and my screen is a small one.
LiceCap is not letting my app function properly. The GIF creation part was quite difficult.
